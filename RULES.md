# OXIDE RULES

► By using Oxide, you agree to these rules. 
► If you break any rules, we reserve the right to ban you from Oxide.
► Just because you didn't know that you broke a rule, doesn't mean that we will bend the rules for you, because if someone else broke the same rule and got punishment, it would be unfair treatment to them.
